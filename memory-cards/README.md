# Memory Card Flip Game

A simple memory card flip game where users try to match pairs of cards in the least number of turns. The game is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Features

- Match pairs of cards with fun food-themed symbols.
- Tracks the number of turns taken.
- Displays the number of matches remaining to win.
- A reset button to restart the game.
- Congratulatory message upon completing the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You only need a web browser to play the game.

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository or copy the files to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Start flipping cards to find matching pairs!

### How to Play

1. Click on a card to reveal its symbol.
2. Match two cards with the same symbol to make a pair.
3. Try to match all pairs in the fewest number of turns.
4. Click the **Reset** button to restart the game.

### Game Logic

- Two cards are flipped at a time.
- If the cards match, they remain flipped and are removed from play.
- If they donâ€™t match, they flip back after a brief delay.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched.
